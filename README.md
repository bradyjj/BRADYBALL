## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è To Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/bradyjj/BRADYBALL.git
   cd BRADYBALL
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   ```
3. Activate the virtual environment:
- On Windows:
  ```
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
- On macOS and Linux:
  ```
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

4. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. Run the API service:
   ```
   python -m uvicorn src.api.main:app --reload
   ```
   This command starts the server with auto-reload enabled, which is useful for development.


6. To start microservices:

   a. Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your system.

   b. Navigate to the directory containing your docker-compose.yml file.

   c. Start all services using Docker Compose:
   ```
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
   This command will build (if necessary) and start all the services defined in your docker-compose.yml file, including Redis, the Celery workers for different scraping tasks, Celery beat, and the Flower monitoring tool.

7. Access the Flower dashboard for monitoring Celery tasks:
   Open a web browser and go to http://localhost:5555

   Note: Make sure you have Python 3.7+, Docker, and Docker Compose installed on your system before starting. If you encounter any issues, ensure that all required files (docker-compose.yml, Dockerfile.service) are in the correct locations and that your project structure matches the paths specified in these files.

## üõ†Ô∏è Microservices Architecture

BRADYBALL uses a microservices architecture for efficient data scraping and processing. The microservices are implemented using Celery with Redis as the message broker. Here's a brief overview:

- **Redis**: Acts as a message broker for the Celery tasks.
- **Celery Workers**: Separate workers for fbref, sofascore, transfermarkt, and whoscored data scraping.
- **Celery Beat**: Schedules periodic tasks for data updates.
- **Flower**: Provides a web-based monitoring interface for Celery tasks.

To interact with the microservices programmatically, you can use the Celery API in your Python code. For example:

```python
from microservices.fbref_service import example_task

# Run a task asynchronously
result = example_task.delay()

# Check the task status
print(f"Task ID: {result.id}")
print(f"Task Status: {result.status}")
